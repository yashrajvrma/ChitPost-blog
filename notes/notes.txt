// the context variable in Hono JS has all the things like request,response, headers, body, env variable and global variable

// All the env variable should be binded in the hono app declaration as a key binding
const app = new Hono<{
  Bindings: {
    DATABASE_URL: string;
    JWT_SECRET: string;
  };
}>();

// generally this declaration should be inside every route i.e declared locally for clouflare workers because in serverless architecture all the routes might be independly deployed on the servers so you cant have the access to the global variable, which ultimately brings the key bindings of hono js which gives you the access to env vaiable in the context of hono js

// const prisma = new PrismaClient({
//   datasourceUrl : env.DATABASE_URL,
// }).$extends(withAccelerate())
